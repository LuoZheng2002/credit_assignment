// home page: view the questions and win rate
// the questions should be paged; each page should have 10 questions

// tree page: after clicking a question, we should enter the tree page. It should be of vertical layout.
// The top is a summary window with question, correct answer, accuracy and an optional model answer if we click on a leaf segment.
// The middle is a conversation window that shows the conversation up to the segment the user clicks on
// The bottom is the tree view like the one in src/bin/bin_browse_session.rs, but now it shows the segments instead of nodes
// The left and right arrow controls how many actions are considered to build the tree, it should demonstrate how the tree evolves with more actions applied
// We can click on a segment in the tree to show the conversation up to that segment in the conversation window;
// if a leaf segment is clicked, we can also show the model answer and the correctness judgment in the summary window.

// use the key q to transition from tree page to home page, and press q again to exit the program
